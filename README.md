# Im2txt Docker Server

This project deploys a im2txt model in a docker container.

In order to build a inference server into the container, we use the following stack:

1. __[nginx][nginx]__ is a light-weight layer that handles the incoming HTTP requests and manages the I/O in and out of the container efficiently.
2. __[gunicorn][gunicorn]__ is a WSGI pre-forking worker server that runs multiple copies of your application and load balances between them.
3. __[flask][flask]__ is a simple web framework used in the inference app that you write. It lets you respond to call on the `/ping` and `/invocations` endpoints without having to write much code.
